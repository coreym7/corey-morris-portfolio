# Corey Morris ‚Äì Data Engineer & Systems Architect

I design and build full-stack data systems‚Äîspanning architecture, process design, ETL development, and backend automation. I own every phase of the pipeline, from strategy and ingestion to modeling, reporting, and long-term maintainability.

My work combines technical depth with systems thinking. I build with the end goal in mind, structuring complex workflows into modular, testable components‚Äîwhether it's parsing API data, orchestrating transformations, or automating multi-department reporting.

This portfolio reflects production-grade systems I've built both independently and in high-stakes operational environments. Every project here showcases my ability to connect logic, data, and execution into tools that scale and last.
