# Corey Morris - Software Engineer

I am a software engineer focused on backend automation, data workflows, and operational systems.
I build end-to-end solutions from ingestion and transformation to reporting and delivery, with an emphasis on modular design, reliability, and maintainability.

This portfolio highlights projects where I translated real-world process and policy requirements into production-ready software.
