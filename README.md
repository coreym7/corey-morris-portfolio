# Corey Morris ‚Äì Systems Architecture & Automation Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases real-world data engineering, automation, and reporting tools I‚Äôve built in production environments. Each project is modular, documented, and structured around real district needs ‚Äî from compliance tracking to vendor integrations.

## ‚úÖ Recent Projects
- [CSV Employee Diff Tracker](https://github.com/coreym7/CSV-Comparator)  
  Automates hire/term/change detection across monthly HR reports using SFTP + pandas.

- [Auto FTP Report Fetcher](https://github.com/coreym7/Auto-FTP-Report)  
  Downloads and verifies time-sensitive reports from an SFTP server, auto-converts to Excel.

- [Attendance Intelligence System](https://github.com/coreym7/attendance-intelligence-system)
  Produces district-wide ADA trend insights with MSIP 6 alignment, multilingual outreach support, and automated SharePoint routing.

- [Reading Success Plan Req Determination Tool](https://github.com/coreym7/rsp-determination-tool)
  Automates RSP eligibility using grade/time-specific cut scores and multi-metric risk logic based on DESE policy.

## üîú  In Progress & Planned

- `discipline-insights-builder/`  
  Automates incident report analysis by hour, grade, location, and staff role, generating multi-tab outputs and per-building breakdowns.

- `rsp-exemption-engine/`  
  Flags students exempt from Reading Success Plan requirements using policy-based logic and SIS program participation fields.

- `hr-data-sync-bridge/`  
  API automation concept to keep employee records aligned across siloed platforms (e.g., payroll, HR, and onboarding systems).

- `federal-funding-strategy-planner/`  
  Early-stage logic modeling for a potential cross-department workflow to qualify and document eligibility for federal program funding opportunities.

## üóÉÔ∏è Archived / Reference Projects

- [CCR Insight Reporter](https://github.com/coreym7/CSV-Comparator) *(deprioritized - will be a dashboard when resumed)*  
  Calculates weighted performance metrics across ACT, ASVAB, AP, IRC, and PLTW exams.

---

Each of these will include detailed logic walkthroughs, policy translation, and system-level design documentation.
