# Corey Morris ‚Äì Principal Systems Architect & Data/Automation Engineer

I design and build full-stack operational systems‚Äîspanning architecture, process design, data engineering, and backend automation. I perform each role within a single build, shifting scope as needed to connect strategy, logic, and execution.

Each phase informs the next. I plan with the implementation in mind, and I code with awareness of the upstream logic that shaped the system. The work is layered, but I approach it methodically‚Äîbreaking down complexity the same way I structure code: into modular, solvable components.

This portfolio reflects that end-to-end ownership. Every system here was created in a real production environment‚Äîfrom policy interpretation to automated delivery‚Äîbuilt solo to solve district-wide needs.
